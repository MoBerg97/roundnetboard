4. Choose how to share:
   - Send via WhatsApp, Telegram, or other messaging apps
   - Email to a colleague
   - Save to Files/Drive
   - AirDrop (iOS) or Nearby Share (Android)

### Option 2: Export to File
1. Tap the **⋮** menu on a project
2. Select **"Export JSON"**
3. The project is saved as a `.json` file
4. A notification shows the file location
5. You can find the file in your app's documents folder

## Importing a Shared Project

2. Open RoundnetBoard
3. Tap the **⬆** (upload) floating button at the bottom of the projects list
