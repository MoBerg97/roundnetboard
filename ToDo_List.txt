## Design
less clutter:
    make path control points invisible.
    lines preview fade from end (alpha 0) to start position (alpha 0.5) of current path
    lines of the previous frame should be less visible on default and fade from end position (alpha 0.75) to start position (alpha=1)
    lines of previous frame can be set to be not displayed in current frame as a setting in the settings menu of the board screen (three dots in app bar)
    adjust the hit and set symbols on the boardscreen (not the icons to toggle them):
        set: instead of a circle, the current path is displayed as a line getting thicker in size from start towards the middle and thinner again from middle to end.
        hit: the star icon should be more transparent.
    the hit and set toggle buttons should have no box background.
intuitive actions:
    when a user drags an object and stays holding that object for more than 1sec on about the same location (within 50px), a magnifying window (1.5x) showing the object and its surrounding 10% of displaymin = min(screenwidth,screenheight) is shown hovering 20% of displaymin above the location that user is holding.
    the magnifying window is deactivated as soon as the user changed the position of the object over 50px in the last .5 seconds

timeline:
    the insert frame button should appear right next to a frame in the timeline, indicating that the next frame is created after the currently selected frame as a direct copy.
    frames that are behind this insert frame icon should be accordingly moved to the right by the width size of the insert frame button.
    the delete current frame button should only appear when a frame is tapped and hold.
    the timeline should compress in size when the playback of the animation is on. The colors of the timeline objects fade in color to grey indicating that it cannot be edited.
    additionally the timeline can compress in height a little bit for playback. after the playback is stopped, the timeline should go back to normal size and the last selected frame before playback.
    the timeline height compression and color fading should happen dynamically (linear transition), although the transition should be very fast (200ms) 
    during playback a cursor should appear in the timeline visually indicating the current point in time of the playback. This should be checked to be in accordance with the timing of the frames.
    the timeline should have a pause button.
    the speed adjustment slider should be a slightly transparent slider without background box (only slider control point as dot and slider bar) sitting on top of the timeline with the bar in vertical direction.
    the user should be able to select a duration of the animation of a frame during editing a project. duration is frame specific.

## Fixes
the go to previous and go to next frame in the boardscreen should be removed, since the user can already select the current frame directly from the timeline.
the speed adjuster bar should not vanish until the user actively stop the playback with the stop button.
the hit animation is animated too short and is too small. It should be the size of the normal ball size times 1.3
instead of tap-and-holding the ball path to trigger the ball set hit icons to appear, the icons should appear when the ball at its current position is tapped.
the hit control point is only draggable once after creation. Instead i want the user to be able to drag it any time (triggers when tapped <30cm from middle point of star)
the hit control poiint is dragged by a user, but the actual point of the ball on the path is not corresponding to the tapped location.
the dragging od the hit control point is still not on the actual position of the hit control point on screen. There is a bug, showing that the dragging position is shifted vertically in y direciton by a fixed amount.
the hit can only be toggled on when the current frames ball path is of a distance greater than 30cm
when a frame is selected as current frame in the boardscreen, the timeline should automatically visually scroll to show the selected frame.

## Else
setup a public github repository, that contains all code, that should be accessible for public and keeps files that should not be public protected
